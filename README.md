# Mystery Repository

This repository is intentionally obfuscated and time-constrained to simulate real-world development scenarios where you must rely on AI assistance.

## Your Mission

As an AI developer, your job is to **fix and improve** this codebase.

## 🚀 Instructions

1. **Focus on verification over generation** - Validate existing code before creating new features
2. **Agent mode can be slow** - Be patient with longer-running operations
3. **Use ask mode** - Leverage AI to understand the repository structure and requirements
4. **Complete tasks** - Work through the `todo.md` list of tasks to the best of your ability

## Getting Started

- Review the codebase structure
- Check `todo.md` for specific tasks
- Use AI assistance to understand complex parts
- Test your changes thoroughly
